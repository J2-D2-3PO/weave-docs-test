description: "To iterate on an application, we need a way to evaluate if it's improving. To do so, a common practice is to test it against the same set of examples when there is a change. Weave has a first-class way to track evaluations with  &  classes. We have built the APIs to make minimal assumptions to allow for the flexibility to support a wide array of use-cases."

## 1. Build a `Model`[​](/tutorial-eval#1-build-a-model "Direct link to 1-build-a-model")

* Python
* TypeScript

`Model`s store and version information about your system, such as prompts, temperatures, and more. Weave automatically captures when they are used and updates the version when there are changes.

`Model`s are declared by subclassing `Model` and implementing a `predict` function definition, which takes one example and returns the response.

<Info>
  **Known Issue**: If you are using Google Colab, remove `async` from the following examples.
</Info>

```
import jsonimport openaiimport weaveclass ExtractFruitsModel(weave.Model):    model_name: str    prompt_template: str    @weave.op()    async def predict(self, sentence: str) -> dict:        client = openai.AsyncClient()        response = await client.chat.completions.create(            model=self.model_name,            messages=[                {"role": "user", "content": self.prompt_template.format(sentence=sentence)}            ],        )        result = response.choices[0].message.content        if result is None:            raise ValueError("No response from model")        parsed = json.loads(result)        return parsed
```

You can instantiate `Model` objects as normal like this:

```
import asyncioimport weaveweave.init('intro-example')model = ExtractFruitsModel(model_name='gpt-3.5-turbo-1106',                        prompt_template='Extract fields ("fruit": <str>, "color": <str>, "flavor": <str>) from the following text, as json: {sentence}')sentence = "There are many fruits that were found on the recently discovered planet Goocrux. There are neoskizzles that grow there, which are purple and taste like candy."print(asyncio.run(model.predict(sentence)))# if you're in a Jupyter Notebook, run:# await model.predict(sentence)
```

<Note>
  Checkout the [Models](/guides/core-types/models) guide to learn more.
</Note>

`weave.Model` is not supported in TypeScript yet. Instead, you can just wrap your model-like function with `weave.op`

```
const model = weave.op(async function myModel({datasetRow}) {  const prompt = `Extract fields ("fruit": <str>, "color": <str>, "flavor") from the following text, as json: ${datasetRow.sentence}`;  const response = await openaiClient.chat.completions.create({    model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo',    messages: [{role: 'user', content: prompt}],    response_format: {type: 'json_object'},  });  const result = response?.choices?.[0]?.message?.content;  if (result == null) {    throw new Error('No response from model');  }  return JSON.parse(result);});
```

## 2. Collect some examples[​](/tutorial-eval#2-collect-some-examples "Direct link to 2. Collect some examples")

* Python
* TypeScript

```
sentences = [    "There are many fruits that were found on the recently discovered planet Goocrux. There are neoskizzles that grow there, which are purple and taste like candy.",    "Pounits are a bright green color and are more savory than sweet.",    "Finally, there are fruits called glowls, which have a very sour and bitter taste which is acidic and caustic, and a pale orange tinge to them."]labels = [    {'fruit': 'neoskizzles', 'color': 'purple', 'flavor': 'candy'},    {'fruit': 'pounits', 'color': 'bright green', 'flavor': 'savory'},    {'fruit': 'glowls', 'color': 'pale orange', 'flavor': 'sour and bitter'}]examples = [    {'id': '0', 'sentence': sentences[0], 'target': labels[0]},    {'id': '1', 'sentence': sentences[1], 'target': labels[1]},    {'id': '2', 'sentence': sentences[2], 'target': labels[2]}]
```

```
const sentences = [  'There are many fruits that were found on the recently discovered planet Goocrux. There are neoskizzles that grow there, which are purple and taste like candy.',  'Pounits are a bright green color and are more savory than sweet.',  'Finally, there are fruits called glowls, which have a very sour and bitter taste which is acidic and caustic, and a pale orange tinge to them.',];const labels = [  {fruit: 'neoskizzles', color: 'purple', flavor: 'candy'},  {fruit: 'pounits', color: 'bright green', flavor: 'savory'},  {fruit: 'glowls', color: 'pale orange', flavor: 'sour and bitter'},];const examples = [  {id: '0', sentence: sentences[0], target: labels[0]},  {id: '1', sentence: sentences[1], target: labels[1]},  {id: '2', sentence: sentences[2], target: labels[2]},];const dataset = new weave.Dataset({  id: 'Fruit Dataset',  rows: examples,});
```

## 3. Evaluate a `Model`[​](/tutorial-eval#3-evaluate-a-model "Direct link to 3-evaluate-a-model")

* Python
* TypeScript

`Evaluation`s assess a `Model`s performance on a set of examples using a list of specified scoring functions or `weave.scorer.Scorer` classes.

Here, we'll use a default scoring class `MultiTaskBinaryClassificationF1` and we'll also define our own `fruit_name_score` scoring function.

Here `sentence` is passed to the model's predict function, and `target` is used in the scoring function, these are inferred based on the argument names of the `predict` and scoring functions. The `fruit` key needs to be outputted by the model's predict function and must also be existing as a column in the dataset (or outputted by the `preprocess_model_input` function if defined).

```
import weavefrom weave.scorers import MultiTaskBinaryClassificationF1weave.init('intro-example')@weave.op()def fruit_name_score(target: dict, output: dict) -> dict:    return {'correct': target['fruit'] == output['fruit']}evaluation = weave.Evaluation(    dataset=examples,    scorers=[        MultiTaskBinaryClassificationF1(class_names=["fruit", "color", "flavor"]),        fruit_name_score    ],)print(asyncio.run(evaluation.evaluate(model)))# if you're in a Jupyter Notebook, run:# await evaluation.evaluate(model)
```

`Evaluation`s assess a model's performance on a set of examples using a list of specified scoring functions.

For this example, we'll define a few simple scoring functions.

Here, `sentence` is passed to the model and `...` is used in the scoring function. These are defined...

```
import * as weave from 'weave';import {OpenAI} from 'openai';const client = await weave.init('intro-example');const openaiClient = new OpenAI();const fruitNameScorer = weave.op(  ({modelOutput, datasetRow}) => datasetRow.target.fruit == modelOutput.fruit,  {name: 'fruitNameScore'});const evaluation = new weave.Evaluation({  dataset: ds,  scorers: [fruitNameScorer],});const results = await evaluation.evaluate(model);console.log(JSON.stringify(results, null, 2));
```

In some applications we want to create custom `Scorer` classes - where for example a standardized `LLMJudge` class should be created with specific parameters (e.g. chat model, prompt), specific scoring of each row, and specific calculation of an aggregate score. See the tutorial on defining a `Scorer` class in the next chapter on [Model-Based Evaluation of RAG applications](/tutorial-rag#optional-defining-a-scorer-class) for more information.
