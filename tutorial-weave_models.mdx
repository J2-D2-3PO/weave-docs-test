In this tutorial you'll learn:

* How to use Weave `Model` to track and version your application and its parameters.
* How to export, modify and re-use a Weave `Model` already logged.

## Using `weave.Model`[​](/tutorial-weave_models#using-weavemodel "Direct link to using-weavemodel")

<Info>
  The `weave.Model` class is currently only supported in Python.
</Info>

Using Weave `Model`s means that parameters such as model vendor ids, prompts, temperature, and more are stored and versioned when they change.

To create a `Model` in Weave, you need the following:

* a class that inherits from `weave.Model`
* type definitions on all class fields
* a typed `invoke` function with the `@weave.op()` decorator

When you change the class fields or the code that defines your model, **these changes will be logged and the version will be updated**. This ensures that you can compare the generations across different versions of your app.

In the example below, the **model name, temperature and system prompt will be tracked and versioned**:

* Python
* TypeScript

```
import jsonfrom openai import OpenAIimport weave@weave.op()def extract_dinos(wmodel: weave.Model, sentence: str) -> dict:    response = wmodel.client.chat.completions.create(        model=wmodel.model_name,        temperature=wmodel.temperature,        messages=[            {                "role": "system",                "content": wmodel.system_prompt            },            {                "role": "user",                "content": sentence            }            ],            response_format={ "type": "json_object" }        )    return response.choices[0].message.content# Sub-class with a weave.Modelclass ExtractDinos(weave.Model):    client: OpenAI = None    model_name: str    temperature: float    system_prompt: str    # Ensure your function is called `invoke` or `predict`    @weave.op()    def invoke(self, sentence: str) -> dict:        dino_data  = extract_dinos(self, sentence)        return json.loads(dino_data)
```

```

Now you can instantiate and call the model with `invoke`:

* Python
* TypeScript

```
weave.init('jurassic-park')client = OpenAI()system_prompt = """Extract any dinosaur `name`, their `common_name`, \names and whether its `diet` is a herbivore or carnivore, in JSON format."""dinos = ExtractDinos(    client=client,    model_name='gpt-4o',    temperature=0.4,    system_prompt=system_prompt)sentence = """I watched as a Tyrannosaurus rex (T. rex) chased after a Triceratops (Trike), \both carnivore and herbivore locked in an ancient dance. Meanwhile, a gentle giant \Brachiosaurus (Brachi) calmly munched on treetops, blissfully unaware of the chaos below."""result = dinos.invoke(sentence)print(result)
```

```
This feature is not available in TypeScript yet.  Stay tuned!
```

Now after calling `.invoke` you can see the trace in Weave **now tracks the model parameters as well as the code** for the model functions that have been decorated with `weave.op()`. You can see the model is also versioned, "v21" in this case, and if you click on the model **you can see all of the calls** that have used that version of the model

**A note on using `weave.Model`:**

* You can use `predict` instead of `invoke` for the name of the function in your Weave `Model` if you prefer.
* If you want other class methods to be tracked by weave they need to be wrapped in `weave.op()`
* Parameters starting with an underscore are ignored by weave and won't be logged

## Exporting and re-using a logged `weave.Model`[​](/tutorial-weave_models#exporting-and-re-using-a-logged-weavemodel "Direct link to exporting-and-re-using-a-logged-weavemodel")

Because Weave stores and versions Models that have been invoked, it is possible to export and re-use these models.

**Get the Model ref** In the Weave UI you can get the Model ref for a particular version

**Using the Model** Once you have the URI of the Model object, you can export and re-use it. Note that the exported model is already initialised and ready to use:

* Python
* TypeScript

```
# the exported weave model is already initialised and ready to be callednew_dinos = weave.ref("weave:///morgan/jurassic-park/object/ExtractDinos:ey4udBU2MU23heQFJenkVxLBX4bmDsFk7vsGcOWPjY4").get()# set the client to the openai client againnew_dinos.client = clientnew_sentence = """I also saw an Ankylosaurus grazing on giant ferns"""new_result = new_dinos.invoke(new_sentence)print(new_result)
```

```
This feature is not available in TypeScript yet.  Stay tuned!
```

Here you can now see the name Model version (v21) was used with the new input:
