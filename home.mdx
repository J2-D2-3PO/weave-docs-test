title: "W&B Weave"
description: "Weights & Biases (W&B) Weave is a framework for tracking, experimenting with, evaluating, deploying, and improving LLM-based applications. Designed for flexibility and scalability, Weave supports every stage of your LLM application development workflow:"
---

* **Tracing & Monitoring**: [Track LLM calls and application logic](/guides/tracking/) to debug and analyze production systems.
* **Systematic Iteration**: Refine and iterate on [prompts](/guides/core-types/prompts), [datasets](/guides/core-types/datasets), and [models](/guides/core-types/models).
* **Experimentation**: Experiment with different models and prompts in the [LLM Playground](/guides/tools/playground).
* **Evaluation**: Use custom or [pre-built scorers](/guides/evaluation/scorers#predefined-scorers) alongside our [comparison tools](/guides/tools/comparison) to systematically assess and enhance application performance.
* **Guardrails**: Protect your application with [pre- and post-safeguards](/guides/evaluation/guardrails_and_monitors) for content moderation, prompt safety, and more.

Integrate Weave with your existing development stack via the:

* [Python SDK](/reference/python-sdk/weave/)
* [TypeScript SDK](/reference/typescript-sdk/weave/)
* [Service API](/reference/service-api/call-start-call-start-post)

Weave supports [numerous LLM providers, local models, frameworks, protocols, and third-party services](/guides/integrations/).
