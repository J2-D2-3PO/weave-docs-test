## 1. Install Weave and create an API Key[â€‹](/quickstart#1-install-weave-and-create-an-api-key "Direct link to 1. Install Weave and create an API Key")

**Install weave**

First install the weave library:

* Python
* TypeScript

```
pip install weave
```

```
pnpm install weave
```

**Get your API key**

Then, create a Weights & Biases (W\&B) account at [https://wandb.ai](https://wandb.ai) and copy your API key from [https://wandb.ai/authorize](https://wandb.ai/authorize)

## 2. Log a trace to a new project[â€‹](/quickstart#2-log-a-trace-to-a-new-project "Direct link to 2. Log a trace to a new project")

To get started with tracking your first project with Weave:

* Import the `weave` library

* Call `weave.init('project-name')` to start tracking

  * You will be prompted to log in with your API key if you are not yet logged in on your machine.
  * To log to a specific W\&B Team name, replace `project-name` with `team-name/project-name`
  * **NOTE:** In automated environments, you can define the environment variable `WANDB_API_KEY` with your API key to login without prompting.

* Add the `@weave.op()` decorator to the python functions you want to track

*In this example, we're using openai so you will need to add an OpenAI [API key](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart/step-2-setup-your-api-key).*

* Python
* TypeScript

```
import weavefrom openai import OpenAIclient = OpenAI()# Weave will track the inputs, outputs and code of this function@weave.op()def extract_dinos(sentence: str) -> dict:    response = client.chat.completions.create(        model="gpt-4o",        messages=[            {                "role": "system",                "content": """In JSON format extract a list of `dinosaurs`, with their `name`,their `common_name`, and whether its `diet` is a herbivore or carnivore"""            },            {                "role": "user",                "content": sentence            }            ],            response_format={ "type": "json_object" }        )    return response.choices[0].message.content# Initialise the weave projectweave.init('jurassic-park')sentence = """I watched as a Tyrannosaurus rex (T. rex) chased after a Triceratops (Trike), \both carnivore and herbivore locked in an ancient dance. Meanwhile, a gentle giant \Brachiosaurus (Brachi) calmly munched on treetops, blissfully unaware of the chaos below."""result = extract_dinos(sentence)print(result)
```

When you call the `extract_dinos` function Weave will output a link to view your trace.

```
import OpenAI from 'openai';import * as weave from 'weave';const openai = new OpenAI();async function extractDinos(input: string) {  const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({    model: 'gpt-4o',    messages: [      {        role: 'user',        content: `In JSON format extract a list of 'dinosaurs', with their 'name', their 'common_name', and whether its 'diet' is a herbivore or carnivore: ${input}`,      },    ],  });  return response.choices[0].message.content;}const extractDinosOp = weave.op(extractDinos);async function main() {  await weave.init('examples');  const result = await extractDinosOp(    'I watched as a Tyrannosaurus rex (T. rex) chased after a Triceratops (Trike), both carnivore and herbivore locked in an ancient dance. Meanwhile, a gentle giant Brachiosaurus (Brachi) calmly munched on treetops, blissfully unaware of the chaos below.'  );  console.log(result);}main();
```

When you call the `extractDinos` function Weave will output a link to view your trace.

## 3. Automated LLM library logging[â€‹](/quickstart#3-automated-llm-library-logging "Direct link to 3. Automated LLM library logging")

Calls made to OpenAI, Anthropic and [many more LLM libraries](/guides/integrations/) are automatically tracked with Weave, with **LLM metadata**, **token usage** and **cost** being logged automatically. If your LLM library isn't currently one of our integrations you can track calls to other LLMs libraries or frameworks easily by wrapping them with `@weave.op()`.

## 4. See traces of your application in your project[â€‹](/quickstart#4-see-traces-of-your-application-in-your-project "Direct link to 4. See traces of your application in your project")

ðŸŽ‰ Congrats! Now, every time you call this function, weave will automatically capture the input & output data and log any changes made to the code.

## What's next?[â€‹](/quickstart#whats-next "Direct link to What's next?")

* Follow the [Tracking flows and app metadata](/tutorial-tracing_2) to start tracking and the data flowing through your app.
